## Getting Started

These instructions assume this is a frontend project that can be served with a static server or run with a Node.js development server if a package.json is present.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (recommended) and npm or yarn if the project uses a build step
- Alternatively, any static file server to serve the HTML files

### Install

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

### Run (development)

If there is a dev script:

Otherwise, open index.html in your browser or serve the directory with a static server:

npx serve .
```

### Build

If the repo uses a build step:

```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
