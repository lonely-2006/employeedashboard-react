# Employee Dashboard

A very simple frontend for viewing employee information. Static HTML/CSS/JS files make up this project.

## Quick start

- Open `index.html` in your browser, or serve the folder with a static server:

```bash
# serve from current directory
npx serve .
```

## Structure

- `index.html` — main page
- `css/` — styles
- `js/` — scripts
- `assets/` — images and icons

## Notes

- No backend required for the static UI.
- Add package.json/build steps if you convert this to a React app.
